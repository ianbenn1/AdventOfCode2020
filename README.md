# Advent of Code 2020


Every day during December 2 programming problems are posted on https://adventofcode.com <br />
I'll try to do as many of them as time allows during my exam season <br />


Due to the nature of the problems, most of them are good candidates for scripting languages, my favourite of which is JavaScript.
I expect to write most of them in JS, I'll try to do a few in Python, and maybe some in C just to mix things up.

Javascript programs are run using node
